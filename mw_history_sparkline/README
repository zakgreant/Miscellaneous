generate sparklines/tiny graphs of recent changes to mediawiki articles

requirements
------------
* Firefox 3.5+
* Greasemonkey 
* jQuery 1.3 [1] 
* jQuery Sparklines 1.5.1 [1]

[1] these libraries are automatically downloaded for use with this 
	script by greasemonkey.

overview
--------
this small greasemonkey script displays five small sparklines
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) in the top left corner of
articles managed by recent versions of mediawiki (v1.16+).

each sparkline consists of a line graph that shows bytes changed over
time.  the line graph is overlayed on top of a bar graph that shows the
number of commits made.

the intervals are:
* the last three years at one month intervals
* the last six months in one week intervals
* the last week in 6 hour intervals

see the screenshot in this directory for an overview of what the
sparklines look like.
