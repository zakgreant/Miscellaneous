generate sparklines/tiny graphs of recent changes to mediawiki articles

*requires:* firefox 3.5+ with the greasemonkey add-on installed

overview
--------
this small greasemonkey script displays three small sparklines
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) in the top left corner of
articles managed by recent versions of mediawiki (v1.16+).

each sparkline consists of a line graph that shows bytes changed over
time.  the line graph is overlayed on top of a bar graph that shows the
number of commits made.

the first sparkline displays changes in the last three years at one
month intervals, the next displays changes in the last month in one day
intervals and the last displays changes made over the last day in 1 hour
intervals.

see the screenshot in this directory for an overview of what the
sparklines look like.
